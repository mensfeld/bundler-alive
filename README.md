`bundler-alive` checks if gems in a RubyGem's `Gemfile.lock` are active.

Currently only github.com is supported as a source code repository. If the source code repository is archived, then reports as not alive.

## Installation

```
$ gem install bundler-alive
```

## Usage

```
$ bundle-alive
6 gems are in Gemfile.lock
..W....
Get all source code repository URLs of gems are done!
.....
Name: journey
URL: http://github.com/rails/journey
Status: false

Gem: bundle-alive is not found in RubyGems.org.

Total: 6 (Dead: 1, Alive: 4, Unknown: 1)
Not alive gems are found!
```

Default `Gemfile.lock` location is in your current directory. You can specify it.

```
$ bundle-alive -G /path/to/Gemfile.lock
```

In some cases, the following error is output.

```
Too many requested! Retry later.
```

In this case, setting [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) as `BUNDLER_ALIVE_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable may alleviate the error.

If you run again, it will resume.
